# Coffe-Delivery
Applying my knowledge in React with TypeScript in a more complex application, simulating an coffees Eccommerce.

In this project the main tech is the useContext hook, but I'm also improving my knowledge in useState and some other basic functionality of React

As in the other projects I'm using some packages like ViteJS, phosphor-react, react-router-dom, styles-components and react-hook-form
